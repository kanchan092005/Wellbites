                While platforms like Swiggy and Zomato focus on food delivery,
                our website stands out as a unique caretaker for both patients
                and health-conscious individuals. We recognize that there are currently no dedicated
                services in the market specifically addressing the dietary needs of those with medical conditions.
                Our aim is to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive resource that empowers users to make
                informed food choices, regardless of their health status.
